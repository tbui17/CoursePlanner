# Rebase warning

- Note that while rebasing the commits I moved the commits around in an arbitrary order. Commits preceding the `Rebase` tag are (almost) guaranteed to be broken if checking that particular version commit out.

# Installation

- Take note of the currently open GitHub issue for MAUI preventing CLI usage: [maui #5975](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/5975)

- The path is where the folder will be placed. Note that I changed the parent directory from `Repos` to `Repos2`. This is because I already have an existing clone in `Repos`, so I am changing the parent directory to `Repos2` to avoid conflicts.

- Click on `Manage branches`
